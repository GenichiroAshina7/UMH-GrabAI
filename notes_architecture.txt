this ai voice assistant will be using a livekit server that will utilise "agents".

there are two ways to complete this project, using a stt-llm-tts pipeline or realtime model. in order to save costs we will NOT be using the realtime model.
the slt pipeline is cheaper and not that hard to implement

will be fully using openai models.

stt = whisper (whisper-1)
llm = gpt (model will be determined later, probably a cheaper one)
tts = whisper


actually we're using the realtime api model by openai
